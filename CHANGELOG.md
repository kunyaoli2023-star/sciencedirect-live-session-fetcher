# Changelog

## Unreleased - AIC review live-session skill

### Added

- Added the `aic-review-live-session-fetcher` skill for *Automation in
  Construction* review, AI, BIM, robotics, multi-agent, and collaboration
  batches.
- Added the Windows Edge live-session runner that reuses one page target and
  captures the official Edge PDF-viewer Save download when network-resource
  capture is not sufficient.
- Added public-release guidance for excluding publisher PDFs, browser
  profiles, credentials, cookies, signed URLs, and private run outputs.

### Validation

- Validated the skill structure and Python syntax.
- Completed an authorized AIC-focused run with 86/86 validated PDFs, including
  68 institutional-browser downloads, 5 OA downloads, and 13 reused files.

## Unreleased - publisher adapters and PDF identity validation

### Added

- Added explicit Chromium live-session adapters for Wiley and AGU/Wiley, Canadian Science Publishing, AIP Publishing, and IEEE Xplore.
- Added same-origin page fetch, credentialed `Network.loadNetworkResource`, navigation/download capture, Chromium PDF child-target extraction, and PDF.js fallback handling for non-Elsevier routes.
- Added configurable download-event waiting to the Python fetcher and the Windows/macOS wrappers.

### Fixed

- Require the `%PDF-` signature before saving any publisher response.
- Filter publisher-specific candidates by DOI or IEEE article number so unrelated same-domain documents cannot be misidentified as the requested paper.
- Keep per-row failures isolated so one publisher error does not stop a mixed batch.

### Validation

- Revalidated the installed Skill structure and script syntax.
- Confirmed successful Wiley/AGU downloads in authorized sessions and safe failure for PDF endpoints that return HTML, HTTP 403, login pages, or challenge pages.
- Confirmed that an unrelated AIP user-guide PDF is rejected instead of being counted as the requested DOI.

## Unreleased - CNKI PDF-only live-session workflow

### Added

- Added the complete `literature-live-session-pipeline/` skill package alongside the existing focused `codex-skill/` package.
- Added `cnki_pdf_live_fetch.py` and its PowerShell wrapper for the exact-title result -> article detail -> exact `PDF下载` workflow.
- Added CNKI result, missing-row, summary, page-count, title-match, encryption-flag, and SHA-256 reporting.

### Fixed

- Ignore dormant hidden Tencent CAPTCHA markup on normal CNKI pages while still stopping on a real visible verification page.
- Select the PDF control by exact visible text instead of the duplicated `cajDown` element ID, preventing accidental CAJ downloads.
- Monitor both the configured batch directory and the Windows Downloads folder for `_blank` downloads.
- Do not reject a password-free readable thesis merely because the PDF permissions flag reports encryption.
- Preserve dotted CNKI thesis DOI suffixes in the documented extraction pattern.

### Security and privacy

- Browser profiles, authentication state, downloaded PDFs, and runtime output are excluded from the package and Git history.

## Unreleased - macOS Chrome DevTools update

### Added

- Added `scripts/launch_chrome_clone_remote_debug_macos.sh` to launch an isolated Google Chrome session on macOS with a DevTools remote debugging port.
- Added `scripts/run_devtools_sciencedirect_fetch_macos.sh` as a macOS shell wrapper around the DevTools serial fetcher.
- Added the same macOS helper scripts to `codex-skill/scripts/` so the Codex skill can be installed and used directly.
- Added Chrome/Edge DevTools probing through `scripts/attach_sciencedirect_remote_debug.py` without requiring Selenium attachment.

### Changed

- Generalized `scripts/devtools_sciencedirect_serial_fetch.py` from an Edge-only ScienceDirect downloader into a Chromium DevTools publisher PDF fetcher.
- Kept the ScienceDirect/Elsevier path as the primary stable route: article page -> `pdfDownload` metadata -> short-lived `pdf.sciencedirectassets.com` PDF URL -> in-page fetch from the live authorized browser context.
- Added generic publisher PDF discovery from metadata, anchors, iframe, embed, and object elements.
- Improved IEEE Xplore handling by starting from the article detail page, normalizing `stamp.jsp` and `stampPDF/getPDF.jsp` inputs back to `document/<arnumber>`, and fetching authorized PDF endpoints from the article page context.
- Updated the README, Chinese README, workflow docs, troubleshooting docs, and Codex skill references for the macOS Chrome route.

### Compatibility

- The original Windows Edge launcher and PowerShell wrapper remain available.
- The Firefox mixed-publisher route remains available for publishers that expose standard PDF links or `citation_pdf_url` metadata.

### Operational Notes

- This workflow uses only the user's existing lawful personal or institutional access. It does not bypass paywalls, CAPTCHA, login pages, or institutional authorization gates.
- Publisher sites can rate-limit or temporarily block live sessions after repeated PDF access. Run small batches, keep sleeps between rows, and stop when challenge pages or access-limit symptoms appear.
- For IEEE Xplore, prefer `https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/<arnumber>` article URLs in the input `note` column. Direct `stamp.jsp` starts can be routed as a personal PDF request and may show misleading subscription errors even when institutional article access is available.
